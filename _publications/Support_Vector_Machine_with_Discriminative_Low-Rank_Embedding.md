Support vector machine (SVM) is a binary classifier widely used in machine learning. However, neglecting the latent data structure in previous SVM can limit the performance of SVM and its extensions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel support vector machine with discriminative low-rank embedding (LRSVM) that finds a discriminative latent low-rank subspace more suitable for SVM classification. The extension models of LRSVM are introduced by imposing different orthogonality constraints to prevent computational inaccuracies. We give a detailed derivation of our iterative algorithms that is essentially solving the SVM on the low-rank subspace. Additionally, we present some theorems and properties of the proposed models. It is worth mentioning that the subproblems of the proposed algorithms are equivalent to the standard or the weighted linear discriminant analysis (LDA) problems. This indicates that the projection subspaces obtained by our algorithms are more suitable for SVM classification compared with those from the LDA method. We also provide the convergence analysis for our proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on various machine learning data sets to evaluate our algorithms. The experiment results show that our algorithms perform significantly better than other compared algorithms, which indicates their superior abilities on classification tasks.
