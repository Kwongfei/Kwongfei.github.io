I am a M.S. student in computer science at the Institute of Computer Vision, Shenzhen University. I achieved a Bachelor (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics) from the South China University of Technology. My interests include graph neural networks, machine learning, and support vector machines. Recently I have focused on adaptive graph polynomial filters, heterogeneous/robust graph neural networks, large-scale graph, and their broad applications. My research goal is to build theoretical guarantees and practical models that exhibit interpretability/robustness/stability for real-world applications. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or my hobbies.
