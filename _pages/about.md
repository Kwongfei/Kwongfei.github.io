I am a M.S. student in computer science at the Institute of Computer Vision, Shenzhen University. I achieved a Bachelor (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics) from the South China University of Technology. My interests include Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Machine Learning (ML), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Recently I have focused on adaptive graph polynomial filters, heterogeneous/robust graph neural networks, large-scale graph, and their broad applications. My research goal is to build theoretical guarantees and practical models that exhibit interpretability/robustness/stability for real-world applications.
Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or my hobbies.
